# CSA Paper Postprocessing Pipeline
#==============================================================================
# This script runs the complete 6-step postprocessing pipeline for the CSA paper.
# It processes model predictions through score computation, matrix generation,
# statistical analysis, and generates all figures, tables, and derived results.
#
# Pipeline Steps:
#   1. Compute Scores: Calculate performance metrics from predictions
#   2. G Matrices: Compute source×target performance matrices
#   3. Ga/Gn/Gna: Compute normalized and aggregated matrix variants
#   4. Statistics: Wilcoxon tests for pairwise model comparisons
#   5. Figures: Generate publication figures and tables (notebooks)
#   6. Coverage: Overlap and coverage analysis correlating with performance
#
# Note: Step 0 (s0_aggregate.py) is optional and generally for internal use only.
# Most users should download pre-computed predictions from Zenodo.
#
# Outputs: All results saved to outputs/ directory
# Logs: Execution logs saved to logs/ directory
#==============================================================================

mkdir -p logs
